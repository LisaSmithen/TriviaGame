 RULES
 A random question is given to the user in which they have four choices to select from. The user has 20 seconds to select the right answer [the timer will count down to keep the user in suspense] If the user selects the right answer they will receive a point. If they select the wrong answer they will be told what the correct answer was and a mocking gif will also appear.
 After 4 questions the points will be added up and the user will be informed of how many points they won and how many they lost. At this point they will be able to restart a fresh game.

 BEHIND THE SCENES:
The page is reset every time it is loaded.

On clicking the button: Start The Game a random question is presented in the question area [using Math random] with four answer options ******  The options were supposed to be clickable but I was unable to complete this step in time *****

within the questionarea. If the right answer is selected from the array, then a point is awarded to "Correct". If the wrong answer is selected the point goes towards "Incorrect" in the answerarea. 

Each question is given twenty seconds which counts down and when the twenty seconds are completed and if an incorrect answer or no answer is chosen then a designated gif will be displayed as well as the correct answer.

The answer area stays hidden until after the user has completed 4 questions, at that point the Correct and InCorrect answers are displayed.

At the end of the game after the score has been shown, a button for the user to reset the game "Do you want to play again" will appear
